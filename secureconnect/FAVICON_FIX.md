# Fixing Favicon in Next.js App Router

Follow these steps to fix the favicon error:

1. Delete the corrupted favicon.ico file from the src/app directory:
   ```
   rm src/app/favicon.ico
   ```

2. Create a public directory at the root of your project if it doesn't exist:
   ```
   mkdir -p public
   ```

3. Get a valid favicon.ico file and place it in the public directory.
   - You can create one at [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or any other favicon generator
   - Or download a simple one from the web
   - Make sure it's a valid .ico file (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)

4. The favicon.ico in the public folder will automatically be served at the root of your website.

5. Your layout.tsx is already configured correctly to use the favicon from the public directory.

6. Restart your Next.js development server after making these changes:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This approach follows Next.js best practices for static assets like favicons in the App Router.
